Data directory
============

Raw data such as tracking files, and crabs' size, burrows' coordinate, video log and individuals' interactions files should be placed inside the *raw* directory.

Tidy data such as meta-information associated to tracking, dataframes, colour palettes, network and R objects, among others will be saved in the *tidy* directory while running different R scripts.
